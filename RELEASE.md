# ü•≠ Mango Cannabis Flower Menu Builder v1.0.2

**Critical Bug Fix Release!** üêõ **CSV Import Functionality Completely Restored**

## üÜï What's New in v1.0.2

### üêõ **Critical Bug Fix - Input Fields Restored**
- **Input Fields Fixed** - All text inputs now work properly after CSV import (strain names, grower, THC, filename, etc.)
- **Improved UX** - Added smooth loading overlay and success notifications instead of popup alerts
- **Better Performance** - Eliminated page reloads for faster, more reliable CSV import process
- **Data Integrity** - CSV import now preserves all data without clearing or corruption
- **Enhanced Stability** - Resolved Electron-specific state management issues for production builds

**Technical Details**: Fixed React state synchronization conflicts in Electron production builds that broke input focus and typing functionality. The issue was caused by `flushSync` and page reload mechanisms that disrupted React's event handling in the Electron environment. The new implementation uses direct state updates with loading overlays for a smoother, more reliable experience.
