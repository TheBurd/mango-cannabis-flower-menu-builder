## üîÑ **Previous Release Highlights**

### v1.0.3 - Auto-Format & Enhanced Features
- **üìà Expansion Mode** (No Initial Overflow): Aggressively increases font size up to 48px, then optimizes line spacing up to 1.0
- **üìâ Reduction Mode** (Overflow Detected): Reduces line spacing first (preserves readability), then font size only if necessary
- **Content Density Aware** - Larger increments/reductions for light content, smaller for dense content
- **Intelligent Prioritization** - Font size first for expansion, line height first for reduction

### ‚ö° **Enhanced User Experience**
- **Smart Visual Feedback** - Button changes from orange (overflow) to gray (optimized) with "Optimizing..." state
- **Single Success Toast** - Clean completion notification instead of step-by-step messages
- **Automatic Continuation** - No manual clicking required, system iterates until optimal fit found
- **Full Range Utilization** - Uses complete slider ranges (8-48px font, 0.1-1.0 line height)

### ‚öôÔ∏è **Improved Defaults & Settings**
- **Shelf Splitting OFF** - Changed default to keep shelves together for cleaner layouts
- **User Column Respect** - Auto-Format works with your chosen column count instead of changing it
- **Text-Only Optimization** - Focuses purely on typography for current layout
- **Ceiling Detection** - Prevents infinite loops by remembering overflow boundaries

**Technical Implementation**: Uses iterative optimization with state tracking, overflow ceiling detection, and automatic phase transitions. The system backs off when hitting overflow limits and smoothly transitions between font size and line height optimization phases.
