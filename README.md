## 📊 **CSV Import Format**

If you want to bulk-import strain data from a spreadsheet, use this format:

```csv
Category,Strain Name,Grower/Brand,THC %,Class,Last Jar
"Top Shelf","Wedding Cake","Green House","24.5","Hybrid","No"
"Mid Shelf","Blue Dream","Local Grower","18.2","Sativa","Yes"
"Bottom Shelf","Northern Lights","Indoor Co","16.8","Indica","No"
```

**Tips:**
- **Category**: Your shelf name (Top Shelf, Mid Shelf, etc.)
- **THC %**: Just the number (like `24.5`) or with % sign (`24.5%`)
- **Class**: Sativa, Indica, Hybrid, or Sativa-Hybrid, Indica-Hybrid
- **Last Jar**: `Yes` or `No`
